<body>
<p>Hi! I'm Dawn. I'm a student in the Deep Dive Coding bootcamp.</p>
<p>I used to be a philosophy student, until I decided that academia was not the right place for me.</p>
<p>So now I'm studying programming so that I can make things with logic.</p>
    <p> My best friend says, <i> "Dawn found the true 'byte' of enlightenment after leaving philosophy for coding. Now, the only existential crisis for her is fixing bugs!!".</i></p>
